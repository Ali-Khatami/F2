<h1 class="title">Components of F2</h1>
</header>
<p class="lead">
F2 is a web integration framework with many individual components. Taking each on their own, they're not very useful. Combining them allows for the creation of powerful multi-party web applications available in a single seamless desktop or mobile experience.
</p>

<section class="level2" id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In some ways, this page is a glossary of terms. In other ways, it's a high-level view of how all the indivudal components come together in F2. The following components form the four corners of F2:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Container</li>
<li>The App</li>
<li>The App Catalog</li>
<li>The Developer Center</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="the-container">
<h2>The Container</h2>
<figure>
<img src="./img/wwp_devices.png" title="Containers and Apps on desktop and mobile"><figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The F2 container is most simply described as the user interface and the location where all apps reside. More specifically, the container is a web page which is &quot;aware&quot; of its contents (the apps) and plays the role of a traffic cop managing context passing between F2 apps (if there are more than one). Further, the container can have any variation of intelligence on a wide spectrum which means it can provide data via web services to apps or simply host the F2 JavaScript SDK.</p>
<p>Each container provider, or individual person or company hosting a container, shall be responsible for including the <a href="https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/blob/master/sdk/f2.min.js">F2 JavaScript SDK</a>. Through the SDK, F2.js provides a consistent means for all app developers to load their apps on any container regardless of where it is hosted, who developed it, or what back-end stack it uses.</p>
<section class="level3" id="the-grid">
<h3>The Grid</h3>
<p>Apps will be loaded onto the container and confirm to that containers' grid. The F2 JavaScript SDK and the F2 standard includes and recommends using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a> which has a proven and easy-to-use grid system. Twitter Bootstrap's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#gridSystem">default grid system</a> &quot;utilizes 12 columns, making for a 940px wide container <em>without</em> responsive features enabled. With the responsive CSS file added, the grid adapts to be 724px and 1170px wide depending on your viewport. Below 767px viewports, the columns become fluid and stack vertically.&quot;</p>
<p>There is only one strict requirement when designing a <a href="developing-f2-apps.html">F2 app</a>: apps should be designed to be no narrower than 320 pixels in width (the screen width of the most popular smartphones) to support a responsive container grid. The container itself will not support a resolution narrower than 320 pixels on either desktop or mobile displays. (The optimal container resolution is 1280px and 'full screen' is just one better.) Except in the case of when an iframe is used to load an app on the container (in the secure container mode), apps can determine their own height on the desktop and automatically &quot;stretch&quot; or adopt until all content in the app is visible to the user.</p>

<section class="level3" id="interactions">
<h3>Interactions</h3>
<p>Apps have context. Context can be shared between other Apps (children) and the Container (parent). The Container is responsible for managing the Context passing; see “Context” for more information.</p>
<p>As for interactions and user experience, the design guidelines and App API will contain information on how to provide users with a consistent presentation layer. When it comes to in-app menus or settings panes, this is crucial.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="the-app">
<h2>The App</h2>
<p>The App is a web page or microsite, written by an App developer that includes its own (entitled) data. Further, an App can be purchased (or entitled) from the App Store, and is displayed on the desktop or “Container”. The App developer is the person or company that designs, develops, and hosts the app.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, a F2 app is one of two things:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>
Display App
</dt>
    <dd>
A display app displays information to users in visible fashion (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
</dd>
    <dt>
Data App
</dt>
    <dd>
A data app is a content feed available in industry-standard formats including JSON, JSONP, RSS or app developer-designed XML.
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="well well-small">
<h4>
About Apps
</h4>
<p>
The term &quot;app&quot;, in popular web parlance, is a program that runs on your smartphone or tablet. In the Open Financial Framework, apps are small web pages and consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and, of course, data. They are <em>not</em> smartphone apps built for the Apple, Android or BlackBerry app stores. You could think of a F2 app as a module or widget or component.
</p>
</div>

<section class="level3" id="app-context">
<h3>App Context</h3>
<p>Regardless of type of app, a presentation or data App has “context” – that is to say an App “knows” about who is viewing it and its content. It is aware of a specific user’s data entitlements as well as information about the user (name, email, company, etc). Additionally, the App is capable of sharing Context with the Container and nearby Apps. This means if Susan wants to create a ticker-focused workspace so she can watch her Apple stock decline in value during Apple’s next product event, the Container can send “symbol context” to Apps and the Apps will be smart enough to refresh focusing on AAPL.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="creating-a-common-look-and-feel">
<h3>Creating a Common Look and Feel</h3>
<p>In designing an App, app designers and developers should follow the Responsive Web Design Methodology. At a high level, this allows Apps to be flexible on both desktop and mobile workspaces. Wikipedia defines Responsive Web Design (RWD) as “a web site [that] is crafted to use CSS3 media queries, an extension of the @media rule, with fluid proportion-based grids, to adapt the layout to the viewing environment, and probably also use flexible images. As a result, users across a broad range of devices and browsers will have access to a single source of content, laid out so as to be easy to read and navigate with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling.”</p>
<p>Further, when considering App design, “’Mobile First’ and ‘Progressive Enhancement/Unobtrusive JavaScript’ are related concepts that predated RWD: browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand media queries or JavaScript, and it is wise to create a basic web site then enhance it for smart phones and PCs — rather than attempt &quot;graceful degradation&quot; to try to degrade a complex, image-heavy site to work on the most basic mobile phones.”</p>
<p>Using the Open Financial Framework’s upcoming design guidelines and App API, App Designers and Developers can take advantage of these available resources to develop Apps on their own schedules. The design guidelines will provide a common theme and offer a baseline for consistency between all Apps on the Container.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="the-app-api">
<h3>The App API</h3>
<p>Markit is developing App APIs, to provide App design and development teams (as well as Container providers) the tools, concepts and best practices needed to produce high-quality Apps.</p>
<p>In releasing the open App API, the goal is to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical documentation on how to build and deploy Apps, how Apps are consumed by Containers, how to build and host Containers, and more.</li>
<li>Design standards and recommendations for App and Container designers.</li>
<li>Articles highlighting best practices and concepts for App and Container developers</li>
<li>Getting-started references and sample code</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="the-app-store">
<h2>The App Store</h2>
<p>The App Store is the place where a user selects (or purchases) either a presentation or data App. Customers will be able to buy an app by using an electronic payment mechanism, like a credit card, but they will also be able to charge their company, or be entitled by a vendor or through another business relationship. Since the App Store is where it all begins, the term is usually used as a substitute for “App Community”.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="the-developer-center">
<h2>The Developer Center</h2>
<p>The Open Financial Framework specification will be published on a website featuring Framework documentation, App developer resources and sample Apps. This site, known as the Developer Center, will be a web site where all of the resources for App and Container developers can be found. This includes the App APIs which will provide App design and development teams (as well as Container providers) the tools, concepts and best practices needed to produce high-quality Apps.</p>
<p>In addition, a key part of the Developer Center will be the ability for App developers to manage their Apps, register their Apps with Container Providers, issue App updates, and more.</p>
