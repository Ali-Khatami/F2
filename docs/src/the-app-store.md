# Developing the App Store

As part of the Open Financial App Framework specification, there is an App Store component. The App Store is the place where a user selects (or purchases) either a presentation or data App. Customers will be able to buy an app by using an electronic payment mechanism, like a credit card, but they will also be able to charge their company, or be entitled by a vendor or through another business relationship. Since the App Store is where it all begins, the term is usually used as a substitute for “App Community”.

At this point in time, Markit is focusing efforts on developing the App and Container specifications, SDKs, APIs, and examples. Details will be forthcoming as this specification evolves.
