## Entity Lookup

F2 is an open framework meaning anyone can build individual components or the entire product. To get Container and App Developers started, there is a JavaScript SDK&mdash;called F2.js&mdash;in addition to example apps as part of an open-source project maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/).

### Demo

Anyone is free to download F2.js from the [F2 project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/). Once downloaded, F2.js can be added to any web page using a script tag:

```javascript
<script src="/path/to/your/container/f2.js"></script>
```

<form class="form-search">
	<input type="text" class="input-medium search-query">
  	<button type="submit" class="btn">Search</button>
</form>



### Versioning

The latest version of F2.js will always be in the project root, and the version number is in the top of file. The version number is also available on the command line by using `node build -v`.

To adhere to industry standards, F2 will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
