## Overview

Providers participating in the Markit App Framework must modify their web sites' authentication mechanism to accept a customer’s authentication from a Container Provider without requiring the user to retype their Username and Password. With an authentication methodology in place between the Container Provider and App Provider, when a customer authenticates to a Provider’s App, the authentication credentials are passed to the Container Provider.  The authentication methodology is also suitable for the reverse, for authenticating a customer requesting content from an App Provider after selecting content from the App within the Container. Authentication information will be passed between App Providers and Container Providers in the form of encrypted URLs.
