% Creating F2

<p class="lead">The open financial framework specification aims to solve many problems. As the standard evolves and new requirements come to light, the functionality in F2 will continue to grow, too. To achieve steady growth and stable release cycles, F2 will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. For more information, browse to the [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2#versioning).</p>

### Roadmap

To provide transparency into the future of F2, we've setup a [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Roadmap) wiki on GitHub. Looking back in time, we also have a [changelog](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Changelog) tracking version-to-version changes, upgrades and deprecated features.

### Commitment

To demonstrate Markit's commitment to perfecting the F2 standard, Markit's F2 container and app development teams are following the technical implementations described in this standard. Those developers are also actively participating in future versions to enhance F2.

### Collaboration

The F2.js JavaScript SDK is an open-source project managed on GitHub. We chose this route to allow developers to contribute to the success of F2's open standard and SDKs. GitHub's tools make collaboration easy, and you can [get started collaborating](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2#collaboration) today.

We do have [some coding standards and guidelines](#) to follow when contributing to F2. 

### Releases

Version 1.0.0 will be released in mid-October 2012. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Roadmap) for more information on future versions.
